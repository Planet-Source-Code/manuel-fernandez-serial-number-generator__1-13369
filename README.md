## Serial Number Generator


</div>

### Description

Class to perform serial number generation, and checking, useful for registering shareware.

Some time ago I was searching for a serial number generator here in PSC, since I couldn't find a good one, I decided to make it one by myself...

The algorithm isn't the best in security but try to break a serial without looking to the code first... This is my first submission to PSC, it was time to give back :).

Please, rate it, i would like to know your opinion
